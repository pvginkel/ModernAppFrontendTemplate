# Backend root relative to the test-app project root.
# In the template repo, the backend test-app is at ../../backend/test-app
# (two levels up from frontend/test-app/ to reach the repo root, then into backend/test-app/).
# Downstream apps don't need this — the default ../backend resolves to the sibling backend dir.
